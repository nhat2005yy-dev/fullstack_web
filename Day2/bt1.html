    <h2>Low and Slow</h2>
    <p>This week I am <i>extremely</i> excited about cooking technique called <i>sous vide</i>. In <i>sous</i> vide cooking, you submerde the food(usually vacuum sealed in plastic) into a wter bath thar is apprecisele set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. In his book, <i>Cooking fir Geeks</i>, Jeff Potter describes ir as "ultra-low temperature poaching".</p>
    <p>Next month, we will be serving <b>Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise</b>.To reserve a seat ar at the cheaf table, contact us before November 30.</p>
